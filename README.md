### Project-1: [AI-Powered Resume Screening System (NLP + DSA)] (https://github.com/blikhitha67/AI-Powered-Resume-Screener-DSA-NLP-.git)

An AI-driven system that automatically evaluates and ranks resumes against job descriptions using **NLP (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)** and **efficient data structures (HashMaps, Priority Queues, Tries)**. Trained on a Kaggle dataset, it achieves **96% accuracy** and provides scalable, interpretable results for recruitment.

### Project-2: [Intelligent Search Engine Using Graphs] (https://github.com/blikhitha67/Intelligent-Search-Engine-Using-Graphs.git)

A hybrid document search engine combining **traditional information retrieval** with **graph-based ranking algorithms**. Documents are modeled as nodes in a similarity graph, capturing semantic relationships and authority. The system delivers **context-aware, relevance-enhanced search results** using TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and PageRank-based ranking.
