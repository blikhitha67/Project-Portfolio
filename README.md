### Project-1: [AI-Powered Resume Screening System (NLP + DSA)] (https://github.com/blikhitha67/AI-Powered-Resume-Screener-DSA-NLP-.git)
![Resume](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-NLP-blue)

An AI-driven system that automatically evaluates and ranks resumes against job descriptions using **NLP (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)** and **efficient data structures (HashMaps, Priority Queues, Tries)**. Trained on a Kaggle dataset, it achieves **96% accuracy** and provides scalable, interpretable results for recruitment.

### Project-2: [Intelligent Search Engine Using Graphs] (https://github.com/blikhitha67/Intelligent-Search-Engine-Using-Graphs.git)
![Search](https://img.shields.io/badge/Graph-IR-green)

A hybrid document search engine combining **traditional information retrieval** with **graph-based ranking algorithms**. Documents are modeled as nodes in a similarity graph, capturing semantic relationships and authority. The system delivers **context-aware, relevance-enhanced search results** using TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and PageRank-based ranking.

### Project-3: [Trie-Based Structural Weakness Detection in Human-Chosen Passwords] (https://github.com/blikhitha67/Trie-Based-Structural-Weakness-Detection-in-Human-Chosen-Passwords.git)

A research-grade password analysis system that evaluates human-chosen passwords using **DSA-driven methods**. Utilizes **Tries** for pattern detection, **Hashing & Bloom Filters** for breach lookup, and **dynamic programming & BFS** for probabilistic guess estimation and attack simulation, providing **actionable security feedback**.

### Project-4: [AI-Guided Adaptive Query Optimization using Hypergraph Traversal (AIA-QO)] (https://github.com/blikhitha67/AI-Guided-Adaptive-Query-Optimization-using-Hypergraph-Traversal-AIA-QO-.git)

A novel system that optimizes complex SQL queries using **hypergraph-based modeling** and **AI-guided traversal**. Multi-way joins are represented as hyperedges, and a custom **Adaptive Hypergraph Traversal (AHT) algorithm**, guided by AI predictions, efficiently finds optimal join orders. Implemented with **priority queues, heaps, and dynamic programming**, it outperforms traditional query optimizers in execution efficiency.

### Project-5: [ClimateAI: Adaptive Data Structure & AI Platform for Extreme Climate Event Prediction] (https://github.com/blikhitha67/ClimateAI-Adaptive-Data-Structure-AI-Platform-for-Extreme-Climate-Event-Prediction.git)

A cutting-edge platform that combines **DSA, AI, and Data Science** to predict extreme climate events. Implements **adaptive data structures** (Segment Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Tries) for large-scale datasets and uses AI models (LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost) to forecast floods, heatwaves, storms, and droughts, providing **actionable insights and interactive visualizations**.
